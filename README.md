# Dog Adoption

![Workflow result](https://github.com/ishubhamsingh/androiddevchallenge_dogadoption/workflows/Check/badge.svg)


## :scroll: Description
An android app to find dogs near you looking for adoption


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
I have built this app as a dev challenge, to learn jetpack compose.

I have tried to imitate the UI from https://www.uplabs.com/posts/pets-adoption-app-acc08609-fc09-4c3c-bf57-d4f7471b3ebf
